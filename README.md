# 👋 Hi, I’m Ali Bariz

I’m a **student developer** focused on learning software engineering the *right way* — through **clear thinking, strong fundamentals, and disciplined workflows**.

I care less about hype and more about:
- Understanding *why* systems work
- Writing clean, readable code
- Building habits that scale with time

---

## 🧠 What I’m Focused On

- **Python & JavaScript fundamentals**
- **Spec-driven development**
- **Agentic workflows (AI-assisted, not AI-dependent)**
- Console apps → backend systems → real-world products
- Learning to design before coding

I believe good software starts with **clear specifications**, not rushed code.

---

## 🛠 Tech I Work With

- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, ShadCN UI
- **Backend (learning):** Python, FastAPI
- **Tooling:** Git, UV, Claude Code
- **Approach:** Spec-Kit Plus, clean architecture, CLI-first thinking

## 📐 How I Build

I follow a strict workflow:

1. Define the problem clearly  
2. Write specifications  
3. Plan before implementation  
4. Break work into atomic tasks  
5. Let tools assist — not replace — thinking  

> *“Code is a liability unless it solves a well-defined problem.”*

## 🌱 Current Goals

- Strengthen problem-solving and math foundations  
- Build small but well-structured projects  
- Move from tutorials → intentional practice  
- Become a developer who can **design systems**, not just write code  

---

## 📂 What You’ll Find Here

- Learning-focused projects
- Spec-driven experiments
- Console and backend applications
- Clean, documented repositories
- Progress — not perfection

## 📫 Let’s Connect

I’m always learning and improving.  
If you care about **clarity, discipline, and real growth**, we’ll get along.

⭐ *Building slowly. Thinking deeply. Improving daily.*
